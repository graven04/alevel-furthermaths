This is a repo with anki decks and their source org file, uncomplete and still full of errors but not being developed anymore.


The package anki decks are far from error free, nearly all of the content is covered but there are still some spelling mistakes,
wrong assumptions and other errors. Which is understandable there were made within two weeks. You can use this as a base for your
own for clean this up and use it. Free for all to use. This is for Alevel Further Maths AQA. 

The source files fm-p and fm-snd contian the images, latex images, and the org files used to make these decks. If you want to 
change this straight from source file you need basic emacs and org mode knowledge and use the anki-editor minor mode. Or most likely
just edit it in anki application by installing the packaged decks.
