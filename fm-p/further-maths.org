***** Front
How to do find the equation of a polynomial with roots related to the roots of another polynomial?
***** Back
- Use the relation of roots to coefficient to find the roots of the *known* equation
-  translate the roots to find the coefficients of the other equation.
  
e.g. $x^2 +3x + 2$ has roots $p = 2$ and $q = 1$ and the equation of the new roots is $p +2$ and $p +2$ then the new roots are $4$ and $3$ and from here you can find the coefficient of the new equation.

How to do find the equation of a polynomial with roots related to the roots of another polynomial by *substitution* ?

let the equation be $x^2 +3x + 2$ 

- if the new equation has roots p+3 and q+3 then let $u = x+3$,
- rearrange for x : $x = u - 3$
- Substitute x for $u -3$ then expand:
  $(u-3)^2 +3(u-3) + 2$ = $u^2 - 9u +20$

- find and plot the coordinates of intersection

- find and plot all the asymptotes of the function

- test which side of the asymptotes the function comes out off
  - this means checking left or right
  - and also if the function comes from top or bottom

- finally find turning points if asked by using differentiation or by solving the line y = k and the function simultaneously

***** Front
How do you derive a formula for a trig function with multiple angles in terms of powers of trig functions?

e.g. $\cos{4\theta}$ in terms of $\cos{\theta}$ and $\sin{\theta}$
***** Back
- write a complex number( in modulus argument form)  to the power of the multiple angle amount

    e.g. $z = \cos{\theta} + i\sin{\theta}$ and multiple angle is $4n$ the
  $z^4$ is the complex number
  
- On one side write the complex number to the power with De Moivre's and on the other side expand the complex number with binomial expansion.

  e.g. $\cos{4\theta} + i\sin{4\theta}$ = $cos^4\theta + 4cos^3\theta(isin\theta) + 6cos^2\theta(isin\theta)^2 + 4cos\theta(isin\theta)^3 + (isin\theta)^4$

- compare real or imaginary parts depending on which formulae you want
  Compare real parts to find $cos(n\theta)$ and Compare imaginary parts for $sin(\theta)$

  e.g. $cos(4\theta) = cos^4\theta - 6cos^2\theta(sin^2\theta) + \sin^4\theta$

How do you find the exact values of a trig function by writing a multi angle trig in terms of powers of trig function?

e.g. $cos(4\theta) = 8cos^4\theta - 8cos^2\theta$
***** Back
By solving both ways and comparing roots.

- solve the trig identity separately to get a list of trig equations as answers
- solve the equation to get a list of roots
- compare roots and the trig equations
- each root maps to a trig equation and is the exact value of the trig equation

  N.B some times you cannot solve the equation however you can still use the rules of roots of polynomials
  to set equation you know are true. e.g. $cos\frac{3\pi}{4} + cos\frac{7\pi}{2} = 2$ where 2 = $-\frac{b}{a}$

***** Front
How do you express powers of trig functions in terms trig function with multiple angles?

e.g. express $sin^5\theta$ in terms of $sin5\theta$, $sin3\theta$,  and $sin\theta$
***** Back
- on one side write $(2i\sin{\theta})^n$  or $(2\cos{\theta})^n$ depending on scenario

- one the other  side expand $z^n - \frac{1}{z^n}$ or $z^n + \frac{1}{z^n}$ to the power of n
 where n is the power of the trig function you want.

  use $z^n - \frac{1}{z^n}$ for sine and use $z^n + \frac{1}{z^n}$ for cosine


- simplify and convert to sine / cosine 

  e.g. if you get $z^5 - 5z^3 + 10z - \frac{10}{z} + \frac{5}{z^3} - \frac{1}{z^5}$

you would simplify and rearrange to get:
$(z^5   - \frac{1}{z^5} )- 5( z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3})  + 10( z - \frac{1}{z})$

Then you covert it to sin's based on the fact that $z^n - \frac{1}{z^n} =$ $2i\sin{n\theta)$

- compare both sides and and rearrange for the $\sin^n{\theta}$ or $\cos^n{\theta}$ depending on scenario

:END:
***** Front
How do you the sum of a series such as $\sin{x}+ \sin{2x}+ \sin{3x}+ \sin{4x} \cdots \sin{nx}$ using complex numbers?
***** Back
- consider the sum of the geometric sum of the series $\Sigma^{a = n}_{n = 0}{e^{k\theta}}$ so $S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$

    e.g. if $n$ in $\sin{nx}$ is equal to $5$ then the sum of the 5th term = $S_5 = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$
    which is equal to $S_n = \frac{e^{ix}(1- e^{5ix})}{1-e^{ix}}$

- compare imaginary or real parts to the series and its sum: imaginary for sine and real parts for cosine

  e.g. $\sin{x}+ \sin{2x}+ \sin{3x}+ \sin{4x} + \sin{5x}$ = $Im( \frac{e^{ix}(1- e^{5ix})}{1-e^{ix}})$

- write the imaginary/real part in terms of sine/cosine

  $Im( \frac{e^{ix}(1- e^{5ix})}{1-e^{ix}})$ = $\frac{\sin{x} + \sin{10x} - \sin{11x}}{2 - 2\cos{x}}$

  $\therefore \sin{x}+ \sin{2x}+ \sin{3x}+ \sin{4x} + \sin{5x}$ = $\frac{\sin{x} + \sin{10x} - \sin{11x}}{2 - 2\cos{x}}$

How do you find the intersection of a plane and a line?
***** Back
- break down the vector equation of the line so it is x,y,z, in terms of lambda
- substitute the x,y,z from the equation of the line into the x,y,z of the Cartesian equation of the plane
  - this gives a equation in terms of lambda
- solve for lambda
- sub lambda back into equation of line to the get the points of intersection

  N.B: if you are given the Cartesian equation of the line instead then rearrange so it is in terms of lambda as well, and do the same

Find the direction vector of the line:

- The direction vector of the lines is equal to $\textbf{n}_1 \times \textbf{n}_2$
  - where $\textbf{n}_1$ and $\textbf{n}_2$ are the normal vector of the planes

Find a position vector of the lines:

- write down the two Cartesian equation of the plane
- let one variable equal a value, any value,
- solve the two equation simultaneously as there are only two variables now
- the value of x,y,z are the position vector of the line

Write in form $r = a + \lambda d$

Substitute x,y,z of the general form of the line into the left hand side of the Cartesian equation of a plane. This will give you and equation in terms of lambda.

When the equation is true for a value of lambda then the line intersects the plane at that lambda
When the equation is not true for any value of lambda then the line and plane do not intersect at all

2) you can do the direction vector of the lines of intersection between two planes dot product the normal vector of the third one. If this is equal to zero then the planes intersect to form a triangular prism.

How do you converting coupled differential equations into a second order differential equation ?
***** Back
the two coupled differential equations are:

$\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - by$ and $\frac{dy}{dt} = cy - dx$

To get a second order differential equation with the variable y

- diffrentiate the equation $\frac{dy}{dt} = cy - dx$ to get $\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = c\frac{dy}{dt} - d\frac{dx}{dt}$
- sub in $\frac{dx}{dt} = ax - by$ into the equation $\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = c\frac{dy}{dt} - d\frac{dx}{dt}$
  - this will give you $\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = c\frac{dy}{dt} - d(ax + by)$
- rearrange $\frac{dy}{dt} = cy - dx$  for dx and sub into the equation $\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = c\frac{dy}{dt} - d(ax + by)$

  and now you have an second order differential equation in terms of y:
  $\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = c\frac{dy}{dt} + a\frac{dy}{dt} - acy - dby$
